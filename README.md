# Python_Fighter_Arena
Simple gladiator style arena between student submitted characters.
Used to help teach students classes and reinforce methods/variables.

Student classes all need a name, health, damage, fight, takeDamage and isAlive. 
These can either be inherited or overridden. Other functions may be added,
but the arena code will only use the stats and 3 functions listed. Added
functions/variables would have to be used within the class like in the Boss example.
    
Please proofread/balance all student code as there is no error catching implemented
and or students may try to make something completely overpowered.
